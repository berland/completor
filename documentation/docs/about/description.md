# Description

Completor速 is a script (Python 3.8) for modeling wells with Inflow Control Technology. 

Completor速 utilizes multi-segmented tubing definition generated by pre-processing tool
(e.g., RMS, ResInsight, Petrel RE) and a user-defined file (called "case" file) specifying the completion design.
(Note: The input schedule file should not contain any keywords or segment definitions related to inflow control).
The information in the input schedule file and the case file is combined
and written to a new schedule file to be included in Eclipse or OPM Flow.
A pdf diagram showing the segment structure of the well completion is also produced as an output (optional).


Completor速 is a flexible,
robust and user-friendly tool that has been extensively tested with a range of reservoir models and well configurations.
All completion definitions must be included in the user-defined case file.
Any part of the segment structure located in the overburden
(e.g., from the top of the reservoir to a junction or a downhole gauge) is not altered by Completor速.
Some options are given by the following examples:

- Inflow Control Technology can be implemented at any time (date) in the schedule file, not only in wells that are operative from the simulation startup.
- In multilateral wells, laterals may be connected to a main branch at any depth, not only the first segment penetrating the reservoir.
- Child branches in multilateral wells can be connected to the tubing- or device layer of the main branch.
