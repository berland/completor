# Setup

If you work in Equinor, Completor® is available internally through the Komodo distribution system.

In addition, you can install Completor® by cloning the repository manually:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/equinor/completor.git
cd completor
pip install -e ".[tests,docs]"
```
and to ensure it runs as intended, confirm it with:
```shell
completor --help
```
and
```shell
pytest
```
This should run for some minutes without failures.
